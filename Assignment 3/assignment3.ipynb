    "A school wants to graduate as many high quality students as possible and have them occupy important positions in the workfield.<br/>\n",
    "This means keeping the standard of graduates high, while also passing a lot of students.<br/>\n",
    "Having talented students at their disposal makes this job easier.<br/>\n",
    "So a school needs to keep its reputation high, in order to convince talented students to apply, international students and local ones.<br/>\n",

    "#### 2) Assess situation: What needs to be done to get ready?\n",
    "      \n",
    "- Risk: we are not allowed to make decision's based on race, gender and disability.<br/>\n",
    "- To do: gather data about students and courses. <br/>\n",
    "- Cost: will be zero in terms of currency, we only need to request data.<br/>\n",
    "- Constraints: time is the biggest constraint we only have a limited time before our deadlines.<br/>\n",
    "- Benefits: we will predict which students have a higher succes rate, so we can actively try to get them to come to our school.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### 3) Data science goals\n",
    "      \n",
    "- Main goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given data about a student, we want to predict if they are going to be successful or not.<br/>\n",
