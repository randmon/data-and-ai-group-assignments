    "### 1) Business objectives \n",
    "\n",
    "    A school wants to graduate as many high quality students as possible and have them occupy important positions in the workfield. \n",
    "    This means keeping the standard of graduates high, while also passing a lot of students. \n",
    "    Having talented students at their disposal makes this job easier. \n",
    "    A school needs to keep its reputation high, in order to convince talented students to apply for their school, international students and local ones. A delicate balance between passing a lot of students, and keeping the bar high emerges. \n",
    "   \n",
    "### 2) What needs to be done to get ready?\n",
    "      \n",
    "    Risk: We are not allowed to make decisions based on race, gender and disability.\n",
    "    Todo: gather student, and course data.\n",
    "    Cost: will be zero in terms of currency, we only need to request data.\n",
    "    Constraints: Time is the biggest constraint we only have a limited time before our deadlines;\n",
    "    Benifits: We will know what students have a higher succes rate, so we can activly try to get them to come to our school.\n",
    " \n",
    "### 3) Data mining goals\n",
    "\n",
    "    Given data about students we want to predict their final result.\n",
    "    Analyzing which courses are failed/passed the most, in order to improve these courses.\n",
    "    How do students interact with the virtual learning environments and how does it improve their chances to succeed in the courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A few questions we researched in the previous assignment:\n",
    "    --> Is there less interaction with the VLE's when students fail? In other words, is there any correlation between failing a course and working with the available materials?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    --> How many students do not submit the assessment? \n",
    "    --> Does the disablity of a student contribute to the failure in a course?\n",
    "    --> Is there a difference between the genders regarding results?\n",
    "    --> Is there any correlation between the imd_band and the failure of a course? Do people in poverty perform worse then others?\n",
    "    --> Is there any correlation between the age_band and the score?\n",
    "    --> Is there any correlation between failing/passing a module based on the highest education on entry?\n",
    "    --> Is there a correlation between region and score?\n",
    "\n",
    "**--> Predict the whether the student will obtain a degree.**<br/>\n",
    "**--> Classifying the difficulty of the courses (Easy, Medium, Hard)**<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Produce project plan\n",
    "      \n",
    "    We are going to explore the data to get an understanding of what we are working with. Also if we don't understand some of the data we can ask clarification from the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "    After exploring we are going to prepare the data for the models by filling missing values and dealing with outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Then we will look at some possible relations that might be interesting to explore while building models.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This stage of the plan will take around 10 hours to achieve and we will use data analysis techniques by using Python.\n"
